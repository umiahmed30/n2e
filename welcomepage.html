  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h3>N2E coding club is a student run club with Dr. Kristin Dana as our faculty advisor. Based on the initial survey, this semester we have decided to offer workshops in these three programming languages: Python, C++, Java. Each language is divided into “workshops” (1 hour each). We want to keep the overhead low for both the instructors and the participants so that the club’s activities are manageable by students with full-time course load. </h3>
    <h4>Key Highlights</h4>
    <li>Small groups: For this semester we are limiting each workshop session to 5 students to make them interactive. We will have multiple sessions of each topic every week, so that all the participants get a chance to learn and teach.</li>
    <li>Learn and teach: The club has a ladder-type structure. For example, initially all students are at level 0. Once a student “learns” 3  and “teaches" 2 workshops (from any programming language), she/he jumps to level 1. This structure will enable us to offer multiple workshops on same topic through out the semester. Not only will you learn a technical skill, but also improve your leadership skills.</li>
    <li>Emphasis on hands-on programming: Instead of a lecture style workshop, each concept is explained using a program. We recommend that students bring their own laptops and code along with the instructor (we are trying to get access to 2 desktops per session for those who don’t have the laptops). We believe that if you know how to code, you can talk about it without slides and use a board to explain the main points. However, if you are more comfortable using the slides, feel free to do so.</li>
